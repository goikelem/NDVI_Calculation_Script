# NDVI_Calculation_Script
This script calculates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It filters cloud-free dry season images, computes vegetation health (values 0-0.8), visualizes results with a color-coded legend (brown=bare soil, green=vegetation), and exports a 10m-resolution GeoTIFF to Google Drive.
